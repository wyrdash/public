## Review Every Day
Things I’d like to have primed in my brain every morning. This is stuff currently churning in the front of my brain, which probably has high turnover but which also has a good chance of getting somewhere new.

1. **Don't Be Violent:** Nonviolence is very important. Also, don't preach it either.
2. **Do the Hard Thing:** Slay the megabeast, win life.
3. **Seek the good in people:** Almost no one is past forgiveness, other than maybe Hitler.
4. Review/update this list

## Lexicon
This is an list of ideas that have gotten hopelessly stuck in my brain. 

### Fresh Prince Epic Poem

It's going to fucking happen, translate the Fresh Prince theme into Latin, and somehow get it into dactylic hexameter.

### On the purpose of life
1. There is no all-encompassing purpose, we have to make our own.

### On personal conduct
1. No one is beyond forgiveness.

### On Morality

### On Spirituality

### On Science & The Universe
1. Science is explaining what we know about the universe. It changes as we learn more. 

### On Health

### On Technology

### On The Self
1. Humans are awesome in the fact that we can examine our own brain- like pointing a camera at a screen it is streaming to.

### On Logic
1. There is no perfect logical system
2. Logic is important, but do not get bound by one system (see above).

### On Education

### On Politics & The Economy

1. We are all biased, but sometimes this can make us better.
2. Biases develop for a reason, but they can become toxic.

### 2014: ++----+-

##### Aug 2014
*New Goal:* Do a sun salutation 5 days a week, in the morning 

Whoo, a lot of things happened this month. I finished my first "real" job, working at Bushy Hill, and what a great time that was. I also got my TWSBI 580AL, which I love a whole lot, and will last me a long time(hopefully). My next "goal pen" is a Kaweco AL-Sport, which I might get in December. I also got my first pair of selvedge jeans, which while it won't fade because it's black wash/black weft, it will still work for what I need it to do. I also started cross country, and so far, I'm feeling pretty good about it. School is also something I'm looking forward to, because I want to learn.
