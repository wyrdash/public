# Codex Vitae

## How to play

1. **Every day:** In the morning, scroll down to Review Every Day
2. **Every month:** On the 1st of every month, scroll down to Review Every Month
3. **Every year:** On your birthday, scroll down to Review Every Year

## Review Every Day
Things I’d like to have primed in my brain every morning. This is stuff currently churning in the front of my brain, which probably has high turnover but which also has a good chance of getting somewhere new.

1. **Cultivate quality time:** With myself, with other people, and with my interests.
2. **Look at what's uneasy:** Don't avoid the unresolved, unwanted, conflicted things that would benefit from attention. 
3. **Slog towards riding a bike on my 100th birthday:** Eat mostly plants. Exercise regularly. Think decades, not days.

## Lexicon
This is an list of ideas that have gotten hopelessly stuck in my brain. 

### Codex Vitae

This is an idea coined by Robin Sloan in his book [Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-Novel/dp/1250037751). The idea is that you write a book, the Codex Vitae or Book of Life, that represents everything you have learned in your life. And it gets stored and read by a privileged few upon your death. Expanding a bit further on it, I think this is a great way of thinking about self-expression. Our lives are filled with a desire to know the universe, and to be known. To leave a dent. This is just my English-major-y way of representing the dent in the form of a text, because words are pretty great. Maybe one day we'll be able to download our brains into a computer and that would more directly represent our full body of knowledge from life.
